## Caprae Capital AI-Readiness Challenge â€“ Project Report

Project: Lead Scoring + Export Tool  
Name: Rofi Nastain

### Problem:
Sales teams often waste time on unqualified leads. Many lead-gen tools scrape large volumes of data, but lack a quick way to prioritize leads.

This tool automates lead scoring based on:
- Revenue
- Employee count
- Industry relevance
- Business location

It helps sales reps focus on high-potential leads first.

### Tech Stack:
- Python + Streamlit for UI
- Pandas for data handling
- Rule-based scoring logic

### Business Impact:
- Fast lead filtering
- CSV export ready for CRM use
- Easily extendable to AI-based scoring or integration with scraping pipeline

### Future Improvements:
- Add scraping integration
- Use LLM for company summary/classification
- Add user login + lead history
